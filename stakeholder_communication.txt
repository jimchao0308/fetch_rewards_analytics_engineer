Hello everyone,
I hope you all are doing well. I have just worked with the data for fetch rewards data, in particular the receipts, users 
and brands data and was hoping to report my findings, possible issues and understand the data better. Firstly I will give a
background of how I approached dealing with this data. Since the data was in zipped json files I used python to read, clean 
and structure the data to a more user friendly format. Once the data was cleaned I ran some sanity checks for quality and 
had a few comments/questions:
1. 	I had the inclination to check if there are unique Users by ID in the User table and noticed that for the same user, 
	last login time and created time there were multiple records. I was hoping to understand why this is the case.
2.	There were a lot of receipts in the data that had brandcodes that did not exist in the brands data. This could be 
	problematic when we aggregate by brands to come up with analysis.
3.	I noticed that the 'brandCodes' are not numerical and my recommendation having worked with databases would be to have 
	the foreign keys numerical to prevent small differences in the string creating problems when joining the data.
4. 	A lot of the data is stored in embedded dictionaries(such as date scanned) that require an extra step of data 
	wrangling. It might reduce the margin of error if we remove this but I would love to understand if this is required
	in some way in the product implementation.

I would love to discuss these points further and schedule a time to elaborate on these observation. 
Best,
Sid
