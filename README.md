## Fetch Rewards Analytics Engineer Coding Exercise
I have answered most of the prompts on the iPython notebook in this repository. The first part of the exercise to convert the unstructured 
json files to structured data was done in the notebook as well and I have included a screenshot with the new structured ER diagram(er_diagram.png) 
as well as the text file(stakeholder_communication.txt) with the email communication to the respective stakeholders.
